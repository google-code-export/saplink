ABAP Make.

Hopefully Zake will become a fully fledged build and test system for ABAP open source projects that span many instances.  The general idea is to create a central "build-master" server that will run a abap report that makes use of the Zake class which will allow the system to build all the SLNKs into a nugget, syntax check, activate and then publish that nugget back to the SVN repository.  Hopefully we will sooner or later add unit testing into the mix so that once the "build" completes you can run some eCatt scripts over the new code and test it out.
