ABAP Make.

Hopefully Zake will become a fully fledged build and test system for ABAP open source projects that span many instances.  The general idea is to create a central "build-master" server that will run a abap report that makes use of the Zake class which will allow the system to build all the SLNKs into a nugget, syntax check, activate and then publish that nugget back to the SVN repository.  Eventually I will add unit testing into the mix so that once the "build" completes you can run some eCatt scripts over the new code and test it out.

= SAPlink Changes =
Need to add an protected activate and check method to the root class, also need to make a friend of the saplink root class that will be allowed to call this which will be the Zake root class.
  * Activate - RS_WORKING_OBJECT_ACTIVATE
  * Syntax Check - CL_SLIN=>RUN


= Zake File format = 
An xml document that has the order in which things are created and different tags for different tasks.
  * Delete
  * Check
  * Activate
  * Install
