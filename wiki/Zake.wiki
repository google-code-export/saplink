ABAP Make.

Hopefully Zake will become a fully fledged build and test system for ABAP open source projects that span many instances.  The general idea is to create a central "build-master" server that will run a abap report that makes use of the Zake class which will allow the system to build all the SLNKs into a nugget, syntax check, activate and then publish that nugget back to the SVN repository.  Eventually I will add unit testing into the mix so that once the "build" completes you can run some eCatt scripts over the new code and test it out.

== SAPlink Changes ==
Need to add an protected activate and check method to the root class, also need to make a friend of the saplink root class that will be allowed to call this which will be the Zake root class.
  * Activate - {{RS_WORKING_OBJECT_ACTIVATE}}
  * Syntax Check - {{CL_SLIN=>RUN}}

== Zake Syntax ==

Luckily Zake will just be an ABAP class so no need to learn any new syntax like ANT or make files.  If you want to create a new build system, just SAPlink the Zake nugget into your system and you are ready to start writing build programs.  Just slap together a simple ZProgram that automates your build.

== Zake Commands == 
  * Install
  * Syntax Check
  * Activate
  * Create Nugget
  * Delete
  * ~~Get file from SVN~~
  * Put file on SVN
